title: 'Donate your old computer to Labdoo : an easy way to contribute to education !'

description: >-
  I heard recently about labdoo and gave it a try. I liked the concept of
  donating old laptops with edubuntu - a linux loaded with educational programs.
  You can just donate your old devices, but you can as well carry some during
  your next trip to deliver them to a school nearby your next holiday
  destination.

  It is very easy to do, alone or in groups, there are a lot of ressources on
  their website, let me walk you through !

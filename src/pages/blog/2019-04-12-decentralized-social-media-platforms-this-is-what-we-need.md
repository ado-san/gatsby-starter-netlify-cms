Would you agree to give all your data to the same company ? Certainly not, but you (and I) do it anyway.. We all accept the long and unread GAFAM Terms & Conditions to use their services. It is an habit that can stop, as soon as we are aware of it and of the alternatives.

That is precisely what I want to talk about, the alternatives. Because the only benefit Facebook has is the number of people on it, we should promote respectful and user-friendly alternatives.

Today we will talk about Twitter alternative : Mastodon !

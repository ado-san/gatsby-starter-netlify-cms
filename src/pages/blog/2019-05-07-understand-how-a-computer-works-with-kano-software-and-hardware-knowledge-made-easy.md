I first tested the Kano OS to play with the story mode, here is a video I found to get a taste of it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE3F9xBoHoQ

It is a super original way to explain how a computer works. Using an old-RPG look'n feel, and a little gameplay to discover the map (based on computer's parts). It is good to refresh memory for the one knowing already the basics, and the new comers will enjoy a more user friendly way to learn computer science.

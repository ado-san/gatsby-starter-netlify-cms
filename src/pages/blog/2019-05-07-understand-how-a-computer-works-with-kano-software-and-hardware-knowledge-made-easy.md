  The Kano package is basically a Raspberry Pi (mini computer) and a Kano Os
  (linux based) made easy and fun to play with. It is made for kids from 6years
  old but is suitable for anybody interested to learn or deepen his knowledge in
  many area.

  Let's go through this topic and play with this fun toy !

I first tested the Kano OS to play with the story mode, here is a video about it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE3F9xBoHoQ

I found it super interesting to explain, in an old-RPG style way, how a computer works in a fun way. It is good to refresh memory for the one knowing already the basics, and the new comers will enjoy a more user friendly way to learn computer science.

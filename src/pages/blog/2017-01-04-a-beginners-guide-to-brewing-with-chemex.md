I recently felt the need to learn a new way to build websites. Something faster, more secure and using a common programming language.

Building Wordpress websites for many years was a great experience but it feels sometimes a lot of plugins and server loads for a simple result.

I used simple HTML + CSS coding for really simple creations, but when it comes to add a simple CMS on top of that, to let the client adding content (like blog post), it can be difficult to set up.

But then I found Gatsby and it addresses all my concerns : security, speed and simplicity !

I first went through all static website generators using this amazing list : [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/). It displays all solutions available with all details needed to make your choice :

* Language : JS, Ruby , Go, Python, Rust, ...
* Template : React, Vue, Liquid, Jinja2, ...
* License : MIT, GNU GPL v3, Mozilla 2.0, ...

+ important information such as the number of Git forks, Git starred, Tweets to have an idea about the community activity and trends.

As I wanted to practice my JavaScript and learn more about React, my choice was all made : GATSBY !
